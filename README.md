# Global life expectancy deficits 20/21 based on WPP data

Jonas Sch√∂ley

Calculate global life expectancy deficits 2020/21 based on World Population Prospects 2022 data on deaths and population. These are estimates based on incomplete and uncertain data and may only act as a rough sanity check for other modeling tasks.
